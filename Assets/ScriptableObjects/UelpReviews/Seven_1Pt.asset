  review: Interesting place. I definitely have a new outlook now, but I don't feel
    like my life is changing for the better much. Maybe it's fate for me to struggle
    on my own, but I don't like what I learned here. You might be better off not
    knowing your future.

  monologueReaction:
  - (Hmm, he seems a bit conflicted still. But it seems like I taught him something
    or other.)
  - (In any case, I told him what I think he needed to hear. What he does with that
    information is up to him.)
  - (Is that fair, though, for his review to be able to affect my career and reputation
    like this?)
  - (Should I start telling people what they want to hear? Or what they need to hear?)
  - (Ugh, this is all so confusing.)
