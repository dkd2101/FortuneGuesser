  review: I cannot recommend this place enough! It gave me the strength to reconnect
    with my family. I didn't know what I was missing until now. But my future seems
    brighter than ever. Thank you!

  monologueReaction:
  - (...This is great! It looks like I really was able to change that guy's outlook
    on things.)
  - (I'm so happy to see him like this. I hope he can learn to reconnect and thrive
    with his family now.)
  - (I think the hard part was telling him what he needed to hear without scaring
    him off.)
  - (But I guess I did a really good job, didn't I?)
