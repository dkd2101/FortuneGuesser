  review: In all my countless years, I've never seen someone this in tune with empathy,
    compassion, and the divine spirit of the future. If you are trouble, or if you
    are not, you will leave this place better than when you entered.

  - (...Wow, I really helped someone like that so much. I can't believe it!)
  - (I thought for sure it was over for me when I first met her. But I really pulled
    through, I guess!)
  - (I'm glad I was able to help her. I think she was struggling for a long, long
    time until now.)
  - (Sometimes talking to even one other person who knows your struggles is enough.
    I'm glad I could be that for her.)
