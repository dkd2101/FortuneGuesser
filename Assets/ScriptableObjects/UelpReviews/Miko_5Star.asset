  review: Ignoring the tacky design of this place, the fortune teller actually has
    a bit of wisdom, or maybe just dumb luck. If you are troubled, or if you are
    not, it might be worth checking this place out. You will hear what you need to
    hear.

  - (...Wow, I really helped someone like that so much. I can't believe it!)
  - (I thought for sure it was over for me when I first met her. But I really pulled
    through, I guess!)
  - (I'm glad I was able to help her. I think she was struggling for a long, long
    time until now.)
  - (Sometimes talking to even one other person who knows your struggles is enough.
    I'm glad I could be that for her.)
