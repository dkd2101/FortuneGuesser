  sentences:
  - I dont care about those photos...
  - I just...just thought it would be a waste to throw them away.
  - 'But...perhaps you''re right. '
  - I never cried when they left, I felt that there was no point
  - But it still hurt. And I didn't want to experience that again.
  - Perhaps that avoidance is preventing me from enjoying my life....no matter how
    long it may be
  - Thank you...I think I've heard all I need to
