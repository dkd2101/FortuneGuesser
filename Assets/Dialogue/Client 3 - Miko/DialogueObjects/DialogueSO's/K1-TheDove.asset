  sentences:
  - I-...
  - 'That dove... how did you....

'
  - I'm shocked you noticed it.
  - That dove meant everything to me.
  - After my first husband, I thought I would never love anyone again.
  - But soon after, I met another, and the time we spent together felt like it'd
    last forever.
  - ...
  - Then it didn't.
  - Perchance you're right.
  - 'I should grieve them... I loved both of them very much.

'
  - And that's why it hurts so much.
  - Thank you for telling my fortune... Well... You're not a fortune teller, are
    you?
  - But that's not what people come here for, I believe.
  - Good luck out there.
