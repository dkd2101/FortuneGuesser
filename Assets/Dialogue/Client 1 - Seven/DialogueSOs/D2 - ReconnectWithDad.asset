  sentences:
  - 'I appreciate the concern, but I don''t think that there''s any chance of reconnecting
    with my father. '
  - 'He''s already very intertwined with my life, but there''s not a chance I''m
    going to feel comfortable enough opening up to him anytime soon. '
  - I don't think I can do much from here, then. Thank you for your time in any case.
