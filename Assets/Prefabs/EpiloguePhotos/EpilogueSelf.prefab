  oneStarDialogue:
  - In reality, I don't know if people can be helped through fortunes at all. Much
    less fake fortunes.
  - Who am I kidding, this wasn't as easy as I thought it would be.
  - People are complex and hard to read. I can't know what everyone is thinking just
    by meeting them once.
  - In any case, I don't think this shop is going to last much longer with the reviews
    I've been collecting.
  - I might want to start job searching soon.
  - At least I can say I learned something.
  - 
  twoStarDialogue:
  - I may not be changing the world, but it seems like I can at least help people
    a little.
  - 'Is this really a con if I''m able to benefit people? '
  - I'm sure that I can improve over time and eventually seem like I can read people's
    minds perfectly.
  - What I'm doing can't be that bad if it does good in the world, right?
  - I'll just keep improving. I know it, that's gotta be my fortune.
  - 
  fourStarDialogue:
  - I really didn't expect to be able to help people as much as I did. Who knew that
    I could have this much of an impact on people's lives?
  - I feel kind of bad pretending I'm reading their minds and seeing their futures,
    though. Not to mention digging through their bags.
  - There might be a better way to go about this.
  - It will take some hard work and saving up money but... maybe one day I could
    become something wonderful... helpful... needed in society...
  - I'll drop the life of cons and lying. I'll become respectable.
  - My new dream. I can, and I will, become an ultimate therapist.
