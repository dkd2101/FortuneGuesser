  oneStarDialogue:
  - This neighborhood has changed so much since the last time I was here.
  - It seems like everything just keeps going downhill. No one has any taste anymore;
    I should just stay home.
  - What's this bulletin board? Community activities? How juvenile.
  - What purpose is there to meeting others if they all are going to leave you some
    day?
  - I'll just stick to myself. Being lonely is better than being heartbroken, after
    all.
  - I should head home.
  twoStarDialogue:
  - This neighborhood has become so gaudy. Does no one have any taste anymore?
  - I'm glad that I wasn't born to the newer generations. All of the best times have
    passed, definitely.
  - No use in meeting no people either, nothing good can come from that.
  - I'll stick to myself. And Sheila, she's fine.
  - At least she won't leave me as the others have.
  fourStarDialogue:
  - This little neighborhood has changed so much since the last time I was here.
  - What's this bulletin board? Community activities? How peculiar.
  - Are people really that desperate for companionship? Well, not me.
  - I'm fine on my own. I don't need others.
  - ...But I suppose it wouldn't hurt to check one of these events out.
  fiveStarDialogue:
  - I never knew that they changed this store to be a flower shop. I guess it's been
    a long time since I've come out here.
  - What silly little people hang out around here. Their colorful clothing, their
    boisterous voices.
  - Oh, who am I to judge. I suppose they're just having fun.
  - In fact, it wouldn't hurt me to make a friend or two like that.
  - Ah, I should hurry up and pick out some flowers. Tulips were always his favorite.
    And roses were *his* favorite.
  - Oh, and I'll text Sheila and see if I can meet her once I'm done at the graveyard.
    I heard they opened up a new boba place in this town.
  - 'Now I just need to figure out what boba is. '
